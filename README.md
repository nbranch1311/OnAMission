# OnAMission

I am on a mission to get out of my job at Deloitte as a Senior Consultant and enter my dream position as a Front-End Engineer / Software Engineer.

Over the course of some months and classes I will be learning React/Redux, I self taught vanilla JavaScript ES6 for facebook, and I am currently a Lead Front End Dev for my client. It is very apparent that my growth here is going to limited to the tech that I can use. More reason why I will work my hardest to find away to that job that will grow me to be a better engineer while seeing the talent that I currently have as marketable and wanted.
